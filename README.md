♟️ # 4P Network Chess Unreal Engine
This repository contains the code I made for 4P Online chess using Unreal Engine 4.26. 

💻 # Algorithms and Data Structures
1. Hash Keys (custom data structure, like HashMap but w/o Values): specifically made for check mate function, where arrays are only used for checking containability and no other operations
2. Min Priority Queue: for collecting continuos movable indices of pieces
3. Heap sort: sorting the movables when needed
4. Bitwise XOR: for setting up the chess board

🧊 # Graphic Optimization
1. Custom Level of Details (4 LODs) created in Blender, each with custom distances for rendering
2. Instancing of static meshes: created board tiles using Instanced Static Mesh, saving GPU draw calls
3. Instancing of Materials: using Create Material Instance, reduce memory pre-loads of materials
